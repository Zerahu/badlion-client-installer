# Badlion Client Install Script for Linux

Update: Badlion client is now back in the AUR, and I definietly recommend that you install it through the AUR instead of manually like this. The script will still function in case the AUR package breaks or you run a distro that does not have access to the AUR. Check out the (I think official) badlion AUR package (here)[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/badlion-client].

Simple bash script that automatically installs badlionclient on (Arch) Linux

## How to use:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zerahu/badlion-client-installer.git
```

2. Enter the directory:

```bash
cd badlion-client-installer
```

3. Run the install script:

```
./install.sh
```
